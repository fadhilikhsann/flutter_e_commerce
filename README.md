# My First Flutter Project

I took the Flutter Developer class from BuildWith Angga website which will also be my first Flutter project portfolio. I create a multi-platform online shoe store application using Flutter and a REST API using Laravel. You can see the back-end project documentation on my GitHub repository link below:<br><br>
